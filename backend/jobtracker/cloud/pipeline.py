"""Pure pipeline analytics over classified cloud mail (issue C7).

The high-volume inbox mine (``GET /gmail/inbox``) is server-paginated: the
web client loops pages and accumulates one verdict per message. This module
holds the *pure, Gmail-free* analytics that run over that accumulated set:

- :func:`company_key` — collapse a sender + subject to a stable company token
  so mail from one employer groups together even when it is relayed through a
  shared ATS domain (Lever, Greenhouse, Workday, …) that fronts many
  companies.
- :func:`summarize` — counts per category for a fetched set.
- :func:`flag_follow_ups` — the ghosting differentiator: ``applied`` mail with
  no later interview/assessment/offer/rejection from the same company within
  ``stale_days`` is surfaced as "No response — consider following up."

Everything here is a pure function over plain data (:class:`PipelineItem`),
which is what lets it be unit-tested without a Gmail token and re-used by the
Phase 2 dashboard-persistence path. No network, no I/O, no side effects.
